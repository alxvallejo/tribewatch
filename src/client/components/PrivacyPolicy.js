			<h2 className="mb-3 mt-4">Website Visitors</h2>
			<p>
				Like most website operators, Tribewatch collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that
				web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference,
				referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Tribewatch's purpose in collecting
				non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Tribewatch's visitors use its
				website. From time to time, Tribewatch may release non-personally-identifying information in the
				aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
			</p>
			<p>
				Tribewatch also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP)
				addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://tribewatch.us blog posts.
				Tribewatch only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it
				uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.
			</p>
			<h2 className="mb-3 mt-4">Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
			<p>
				Certain visitors to Tribewatch's websites choose to interact with Tribewatch in ways that require
				Tribewatch to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that
				Tribewatch gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up
				for a blog at https://tribewatch.us to provide a username and email address.
			</p>
			<h2 className="mb-3 mt-4">Security</h2>
			<p>
				The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of
				transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use
				commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute
				security.
